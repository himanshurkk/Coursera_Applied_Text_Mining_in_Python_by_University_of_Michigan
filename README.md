# Coursera_Applied_Text_Mining_in_Python_by_University_of_Michigan
>This course will introduce the learner to text mining and text manipulation basics. The course begins with an understanding of how text >is handled by python, the structure of text both to the machine and to humans, and an overview of the nltk framework for manipulating >text. The second week focuses on common manipulation needs, including regular expressions (searching for text), cleaning text, and >preparing text for use by machine learning processes. The third week will apply basic natural language processing methods to text, and >demonstrate how text classification is accomplished. The final week will explore more advanced methods for detecting the topics in >documents and grouping them by similarity (topic modelling).
